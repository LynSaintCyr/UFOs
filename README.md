# UFOs

In this module, we created a table with all UFO sightings information with date filter only and  we also added other filters such as City, State, Country, and Shape. 

## Background 

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
